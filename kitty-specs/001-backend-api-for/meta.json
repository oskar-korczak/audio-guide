  "friendly_name": "Backend API for Audio Generation",
  "source_description": "Create a backend API with a single endpoint that accepts attraction data (name, category, latitude, longitude) and returns generated audio. Move OpenAI (facts + script generation) and ElevenLabs (audio generation) calls to this backend to secure API keys. Deploy to a free-tier hosting platform. Frontend will call this single endpoint instead of making direct API calls.",
